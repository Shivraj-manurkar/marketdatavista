The market size was valued at approximately <strong>$1.2 billion</strong> in 2023 and is projected to reach nearly <strong>$1.8 billion</strong> by 2032. This growth represents a <strong>CAGR of 5.3%</strong> from 2024 to 2032.</p> <p>Several factors contribute to this positive trajectory, including an increasing emphasis on gardening for mental well-being and environmental sustainability. Additionally, the trend towards home improvement and outdoor beautification has motivated consumers to invest in high-quality gardening tools, including pruners. The rising income levels and changing consumer preferences towards premium garden tools have also played a significant role in this market upsurge.</p> <p style="margin-top:20px;"><strong></strong></p> <p>As we move into the forecast period, strong growth is anticipated across various segments of the garden pruners market.
