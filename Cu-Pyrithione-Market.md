According to market research, the global Cu pyrithione market size was valued at approximately $150 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of around 6% from 2024 to 2032. This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for effective anti-fungal and antimicrobial agents in consumer products, as well as the rising awareness about scalp and skin health amongst consumers.</p><p>Additionally, the growth of the personal care and cosmetics industry, coupled with changing consumer preferences toward natural and effective ingredients, is expected to further propel the demand for Cu pyrithione. The rising incidences of scalp and skin-related issues, such as dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, have also led to a surge in the use of Cu pyrithione in various formulations.
